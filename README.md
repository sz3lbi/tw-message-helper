# Tribal Wars Message Helper

A Tribal Wars game message helper tool that reads messages from JSON format, automatically fills in a form and sends it.  
The values in the script's form fields are automatically updated, depending on the information stored in the browser's Local Storage.

The script has been written in the TypeScript language and is compiled to the JavaScript (ES6) with suitable UserScript headers using webpack.
